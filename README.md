# MIL-NanoRM
A multiple instance learning framework for RNA modification detection in direct RNA sequencing(DRS) IVT data.
Model architecture inspired by m6anet

This is a temporary code repository:
1. DeepRead is designed to reach read-level detection and compute loss directly at the read-level with labels available.
2. PseudoNet is specifically designed for psi/m1psi modification detection in IVT RNA data
